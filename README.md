ü©∏ Automated Blood Draw System Using Computer Vision & Robotics
This project is a prototype of an automated blood-draw system developed as a graduation project at Birzeit University. It combines computer vision and a 6-DOF robotic arm to detect veins in the human arm using image processing techniques.

‚úÖ Key Features:

Real-time image acquisition and vein detection using OpenCV

Integration with a 6-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm for precise alignment

Designed with safety and precision in mind

üõ†Ô∏è Current Status: The system successfully detects veins and aligns the robotic arm for potential insertion. However, needle injection was not implemented due to safety and ethical considerations in a prototype environment.
